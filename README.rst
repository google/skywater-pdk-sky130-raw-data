`sky130-raw-data` - Raw data collected about the SKY130 process technology
==========================================================================

This repository contains the raw data that has been collected about SkyWater's 130nm bulk process technology to help validate the `fully open source, manufacturable, SK130 PDK that Google maintains <https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk>`_.

The initial data that is available in this repository was collected under contract by `CoolCAD Electronics LLC <https://coolcadelectronics.com/>`_ using the manufacturing test tile created by SkyWater. It is expected that more data will be added to this repository as other groups start to also collect experimental data.

Experimental Data
=================

The experimental data in this repository is currently stored in the `.mdm` file format.


**Current** proprietary SkyWater Test Tile
------------------------------------------

Documentation about the existing proprietary test tile can be found in the `docs/sky130-testtile directory <./docs/sky130-testtile>`_.


**Future** fully open source Test Tile
--------------------------------------

Google, NIST, and University of Michigan are working together to create a fully open test tile design using the `OpenFASoC generator approach <https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC>`_ and open source tooling. More details can be found at the following links;

SKY130 Process Node
===================

The SKY130 is a mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology originally developed internally by Cypress Semiconductor before being spun out into SkyWater Technology and made accessible to general industry. SkyWater and Googleâ€™s collaboration is now making this technology accessible to everyone!

The SKY130 Process node technology stack consists of;

* Support for internal 1.8V with 5.0V I/Os (operable at 2.5V)
* 1 level of local interconnect
* 5 levels of metal
* Is inductor-capable
* Has high sheet rho poly resistor
* Optional MiM capacitors
* Includes SONOS shrunken cell
* Supports 10V regulated supply
* HV extended-drain NMOS and PMOS


The `SKY130 Process Node`_ is an extremely flexible offering, including many normally *optional* features as standard (features like the local interconnect, SONOS functionality, MiM capacitors, and more). This provides the designer with a **wide range** of flexibility in design choices.
